the create/alter/drop table AST should really be structured like (create (table :name ... :columns ...)) and (alter (table ...))
where the (table ...) part is a shared table description. then a new format sub-protocols should be started for create and alter
that works from the shared (table ...) ast node.

same applies to sql-create-index, sql-drop-index, sql-create-sequence, sql-drop-sequence


introduce a named-sql-syntax-node, add a print-object method for it.
